I'm a first-year PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Aris Filos-Ratsikas](https://arisfilosratsikas.com/), within the [Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs).
Prior to that, I received a [MCompSci](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/course-listing/computer-science) from the University of Oxford, where I was also fortunate to be supervised by [Paul Goldberg](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/paul.goldberg/index1.html) for my thesis.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science and Economics, namely in the field of Algorithmic Game Theory. Thus far in my PhD, I have primarily worked on topics in Auction Theory, investigating the complexity of equilibrium computation in single-item first-price auctions, as well as autobidding auctions.
